These questions are for an anonymous social messaging platform, like Qooh.me, and should be suitable for a diverse audience of developers, especially curious junior developers. Avoid overly technical jargon or personal/sensitive topics. Focus on universal developer experiences such as learning, challenges, tools, and growth. For example, your output should be structured like this: 'Whatâ€™s one piece of advice you wish you knew as a junior dev?||How do you choose what to build when learning something new?||What tech stack helped you land your first job?'. Ensure the questions are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute to a positive and welcoming conversational environment for developers."
